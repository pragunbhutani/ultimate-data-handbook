One of the most important things you can do to ensure that your product analytics is effective is to design
your analytics events correctly.

In this chapter, we will discuss the key principles of event design and how you can use them to create an
effective event tracking strategy for your product.

## What are Analytics Events?

Analytics events are user interactions with your product that you track using an analytics tool. These events
can be anything from clicking a button to making a purchase.

Events are the building blocks of your product analytics. By tracking events, you can understand how users are
interacting with your product, identify areas for improvement, and measure the impact of changes you make to
your product.

### Which Events to Track?

When deciding which events to track, there are two key principles you should keep in mind:

#### 1. Be Relevant

Events should be relevant to your business goals. This means that you should only track events that are
meaningful to your product and your users. For example, if you're building an e-commerce platform, you should
track events like "product_added_to_cart" and "purchase_completed", but you don't need to track events like
"page_scrolled" or "item_hovered".

#### 2. Be Actionable

Events should be actionable, meaning that they should provide you with information that you can act on. For
example, if you track an event like "signup_button_clicked", you can use this information to optimize your
signup flow and increase the number of signups.

## Event Design Principles

When designing events for your product analytics, there are a few key principles you should keep in mind to
ensure that your events are effective and useful.

### Event Names

When naming events, use a consistent naming convention to make it easier to analyze and compare events.

#### Use a noun-verb format

#### Use snake_case

#### Use descriptive names

### Event Properties

Properties are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the event. For example, you can
include properties like "product_id" or "category" with a "product_viewed" event to track which product was
viewed.
