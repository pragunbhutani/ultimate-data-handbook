# Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process for analyzing data and presenting
actionable information to help executives, managers and other corporate end users make informed business decisions.

Commonly, business intelligence is used to refer to the creation of reports, dashboards, and data visualizations
to help organizations make data-driven decisions.

While Product Analytics can also be included under the umbrella of Business Intelligence, this term is most commonly
used to refer to tools that help you visualise SQL data.
