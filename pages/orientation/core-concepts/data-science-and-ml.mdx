# Data Science and Machine Learning

Data science and machine learning are two of the most popular fields in technology today.
They are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing.

Data science is the process of extracting knowledge and insights from data, while machine learning is a
subset of data science that focuses on building predictive models from data.
