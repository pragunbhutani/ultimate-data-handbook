# Startup Data Journey

Hello reader, this section is meant to serve as a basic orientation for those who are new to the world of data and analytics. This, along with the [Core Concepts](/core-concepts) section, will help you understand the basics of data teams, how they work and meanings of some of the common terms used in the data world.

Start here if you'd like to understand the very basics of what a data team does and how it fits into an organisation.
However, if you're already familiar with the roles and responsibilities of a data team, you might want to skip this section.

We'll walk through the journey of a startup called "Jaffle Shop" - an e-commerce store that sells jaffles online - and how they use data to make decisions.
