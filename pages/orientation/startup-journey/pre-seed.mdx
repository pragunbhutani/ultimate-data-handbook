# MVP & Pre-Seed

## MVP

**Number of Employees**: 0

At the first level, the startup has a simple web application that is hosted on a single server.
The web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and place an order for a jaffle.

At this stage, you're not worried about scaling. You're just trying to get a product out the door.
You haven't raised any money yet and you're probably still trying to build this product in your spare time.

### Data - Not Yet

You have a very small amount of traffic and you can simply log into your SQL database to check if anyone has signed up or purchased anything.
At this early stage, you probably even remember the names of your users and can reach out to them directly if you need to.

## Pre-Seed

**Number of Employees**: 1

You've been trying to get the word out about your product by posting on social media, running ads, and reaching out to bloggers and influencers.
As Jaffle Shop grows, you start to see more traffic. You're starting to get more users signing up and purchasing jaffles.

You've also added some more functionality to your web application. Users can now add jaffles to their cart and purchase them using a credit card.
You've also introduces two new kinds of jaffles in addition to "The Classic": "The Veggie" and "The Meat Lover".

### Basic Growth Metrics

You wonder how many users are signing up and purchasing jaffles each day. You also want to know which jaffles are the most popular and which users are the most valuable.
However your sales are still small enough for you to be able to manually track this information in a spreadsheet that you update every weekend.

You also install Google Analytics to track how many users are visiting your site and where they are coming from.
