# Early Stage

In the early stage of a B2B SaaS company, the focus is on validating the concept,
building a minimum viable product (MVP), and acquiring the first customers.

The key business functions at this stage include product development, founders, and initial sales efforts.

This stage is also called the "pre-product-market fit" stage, where the company is still
testing the product offering and refining the product based on early feedback from the market

Let's examine the key challenges, the key metrics that need to be addressed, and
how data can be used to address these challenges.

### Set Up Revenue Reporting

Throughout the lifetime of a B2B SaaS company, your monthly or annual recurring revenue (MRR/ARR) is a key metric to track.
This metric is the central pillar of your financial health and growth and is absolutely necessary to
have a clear understanding of your revenue streams.

#### Motivation

You should be able to connect the dots between your revenue and your customer acquisition, retention, and expansion efforts.

You should also be able to evaluate the impact of strategic decisions on your revenue, set targets
and report on your progress to your team and investors.

#### Action

  to drill down into the data by product, category, customer segment, etc.
- Track growth and identify trends, including the impact of new customers, churn, and expansion revenue.

#### Desired Outcome

- Ability to set revenue targets and track progress towards them
- Ability to evaluate the impact of strategic decisions on revenue and identify key drivers of growth

### Implement a Customer Data Platform and Basic Analytics

Product analytics is crucial for understanding how users interact with your product and how you can improve their experience.
In the early stage of starting a B2B SaaS company, you should focus on setting up basic analytics to understand if your
product is meeting the needs of your target customers.

In the early stage, your product is likely to be evolving rapidly, so instead of focusing on complex analytics,
you should make sure that you are able to analyse the your signup process, onboarding / activation and engagement metrics.

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a tool that collects, unifies, and organizes customer data from various sources.
If your application can be accessed through multiple channels (web, mobile, etc.), a CDP can help you track user behavior
across these channels and provide a unified view of the customer journey.

#### Motivation

You need to understand how users are interacting with your product to identify areas for improvement,
maximize value delivery and track the impact of product changes.

#### Action

- Implement analytics events that track key user actions through your signup, onboarding and activation processes. This could include:
  - Signup
  - Onboarding completion
  - First login
  - First feature usage
- Implement analytics events that track key user actions that indicate engagement with your product and valu delivery. This could include:
  - Feature usage
  - Content consumption
  - Sharing
  - Purchases
- Implement a Customer Data Platform (CDP) to collect and unify customer data from various sources

#### Desired Outcome

- Improved user signup and onboarding completion rates
- Increased user activation and engagement
- Identify both high and low value customers based on their engagement with the product

### Collect User Feedback and Insights

User feedback is crucial for understanding how users perceive your product and what improvements can be made.
This is especially important in the early stage of a B2B SaaS company when you are still refining your product offering.

#### Motivation

You should be able to understand the needs and preferences of your target customers and how well your product is meeting those needs.

#### Action

- Implement a mechanism for users to communicate feedback, suggestions, and issues (Qualitative).
- Implement surveys, NPS scores, and other feedback mechanisms to collect structured feedback (Quantitative).

#### Desired Outcome
