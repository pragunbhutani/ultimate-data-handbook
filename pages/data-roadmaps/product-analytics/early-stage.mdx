# Early Stage

At the early stage of a company, the focus is on acquiring your first customers,
understanding their needs and preferences, and converting them into paying customers.

The journey of a customer through the product is defined by the acronyms `AARRR` which stands for:

- **Acquisition** - Getting the customers to your product
- **Activation** - Getting the customers to engage with your product
- **Retention** - Keeping the customers engaged with your product
- **Revenue** - Driving sales
- **Referral** - Getting customers to refer your product to others

## Key Challenges

The key challenges at this stage are:

- Acquiring your first customers
- Getting the customers to engage with and consider your products or services
- Understanding the needs and preferences of your customers
- Converting the users into paying customers or subscribers
- Retaining the customers and keeping them engaged with your product

## Analytics Goals

Your product analytics efforts at this stage should focus on:

### Acquisition Funnel

Understanding the performance of your acquisition funnel and identifying the bottlenecks that are preventing users from converting.
This includes understanding the sources of traffic, the conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, and the user behavior that leads to conversion.

Hence you should make sure you're tracking the following metrics:

- Number of visitors to your website from different sources. This includes organic search, paid search, social media, and referrals.
  You should make sure you're able to accurately attribute the source of each visitor.
- Number of signups or registrations. If your signup process is multi-step, you should track the drop-off rates at each step.
- Number of users who complete the onboarding process and become active users.

### Engagement Metrics

Once users have signed up, you need to track their engagement with your product. This includes:

- Number of sessions per user and the average session duration
- Number of users who indicate interest in your product. Based on the kind of product you're building, this could be the number of users who:
  - View products or add items to their cart
  - Create a project, or other similar actions
  - Complete a tutorial or onboarding process, or a level in a game
  - Watch a video or read an article
- Number of users who complete a key action that indicates they are getting value from your product. This could be:
  - Making a purchase
  - Completing a project or sharing a project with others
  - Uploading a file or creating content
  - Completing a level in a game

### Revenue Metrics

Once users are engaged with your product, you need to track the revenue generated by your product.
The guiding principle here is to understand the value that your product is delivering to your customers and to capture a portion of that value.

In case of an e-commerce product, this could be the number of purchases and the average order value.

In case of a subscription product, once a user has converted, the revenue is largely in the form of recurring revenue.
For users who are already subscribed, you should track if
