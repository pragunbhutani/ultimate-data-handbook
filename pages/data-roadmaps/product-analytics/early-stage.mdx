# Early Stage

At the early stage of a company, the focus is on acquiring your first customers,
understanding their needs and preferences, and converting them into paying customers.

The journey of a customer through the product is defined by the acronyms `AARRR` which stands for:

- **Acquisition** - Getting the customers to your product
- **Activation** - Getting the customers to engage with your product
- **Retention** - Keeping the customers engaged with your product
- **Revenue** - Driving sales
- **Referral** - Getting customers to refer your product to others

## Key Challenges

The key challenges at this stage are:

- Acquiring your first customers
- Getting the customers to engage with and consider your products or services
- Converting the users into paying customers or subscribers
- Retaining the customers and keeping them engaged with your product

## Analytics Goals

Your product analytics efforts at this stage should focus on:

### Acquisition Funnel

Understanding the performance of your acquisition funnel and identifying the bottlenecks that are preventing users from converting.
This includes understanding the sources of traffic, the conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, and the user behavior that leads to conversion.

Hence you should make sure you're tracking the following metrics:

- Number of visitors to your website from different sources. This includes organic search, paid search, social media, and referrals.
  You should make sure you're able to accurately attribute the source of each visitor.
- Number of signups or registrations. If your signup process is multi-step, you should track the drop-off rates at each step.
- Number of users who complete the onboarding process and become active users.

### Engagement Metrics

Once users have signed up, you need to track their engagement with your product. This includes:

- Number of sessions per user and the average session duration
- Number of users who indicate interest in your product. Based on the kind of product you're building, this could be the number of users who:
  - View products or add items to their cart
  - Create a project, or other similar actions
  - Complete a tutorial or onboarding process, or a level in a game
  - Watch a video or read an article
- Number of users who complete a key action that indicates they are getting value from your product. This could be:
  - Making a purchase
  - Completing a project or sharing a project with others
  - Uploading a file or creating content
  - Completing a level in a game

### Revenue Metrics

Once users are engaged with your product, you need to track the revenue generated by your product.
The guiding principle here is to understand the value that your product is delivering to your customers and to capture a portion of that value.

In case of an e-commerce product, this could be the number of purchases and the average order value.

In case of a subscription product, once a user has converted, the revenue is largely in the form of recurring revenue.
For users who are already subscribed, you should track if they are renewing their subscriptions and if they are upgrading to higher tiers.

## Todo List

- Set up Google Analytics to track the number of visitors to your website and the sources of traffic
- Set up a consumer data platform to receive data from your website and other sources
- Set up event tracking to track your signup funnel and the onboarding process
- Set up event tracking to track the key actions that indicate user engagement with your product
- (Optional) Set up a product analytics visualization tool to visualize the data from your consumer data platform

## Suggested Tools

Please note that these views are my own and not endorsed by the respective companies.
Remember to do your own research before choosing a tool.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is useful for tracking the number of visitors to your website and the sources of traffic.
It's a good general purpose tool for tracking the top of your acquisition funnel.

In the early stages, you can also use Google Analytics for marketing attribution and tracking the performance
of your marketing campaigns, however, as you scale, you may need more advanced tools for this purpose.

### Consumer Data Platform

A consumer data platform can help you collect data from your website and other sources
and route it to your data warehouse or other tools for analysis, visualization, and activation.

Here are two popular consumer data platforms:

- [Segment](https://segment.com/) Segment is the incumbent in this space and has a large number of integrations with other tools.
- [RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/): RudderStack is an open-source alternative to Segment that you can host on your own infrastructure.
  They also have a managed cloud offering, which may cost less than Segment for high volumes of data.

As of writing this guide, I recommend using RudderStack over Segment because it is more cost-effective for high volumes of data.

### Product Analytics Visualization

A product analytics visualization tool can help you visualize the data from your consumer data platform with a
point and click interface. This can be useful for creating dashboards for your team or for sharing data with other stakeholders
without needing to write SQL queries.

Here are some popular product analytics visualization tools:

- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/): Amplitude is the incumbent in this space.
- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/): PostHog is a new open-source alternative to Amplitude that you can host on your own infrastructure.
  They also have a managed cloud offering, which may cost less than Amplitude for high volumes of data.

I'm currently a fan of PostHog because they've been developing features at a rapid pace and I love the direction they're heading in.
